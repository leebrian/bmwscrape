Another mess-around project to learn more pythonTM
I'm thinking about buying or leasing a bmw over the course of the next 12 months, so I want to track things over time on a few models of interest to me:
Money Factor from BMWFinancial
Resididual
Credits
Suggested dealer contribution
Monthly payment

Whenever I talk to the local dealers, they say this never changes. But it's hard to find historical data. So to take a page from the movie Primer, I'll start tracking history and hopefully will be useful around this time next year.

Resources:
config_scrape.json has pages from bmwusa.com that seem to follow a standard pattern of something like this showing up in the html:
"Offer not valid in Puerto Rico. Lease financing available on new 2018 BMW 330i xDrive Gran Turismo models from participating BMW Centers through BMW Financial Services through July 02, 2018, to eligible, qualified customers with excellent credit history who meet BMW Financial Services' credit requirements. Monthly lease payments of $549 per month for 36 months is based on an adjusted capitalized cost of $44,319 (MSRP of $47,445, including destination and handling fee of $995, less $3,000 customer down, $0 security deposit and suggested dealer contribution of $126). Actual MSRP may vary. Dealer contribution may vary and could affect your actual lease payment.

Models pictured may be shown with metallic paint and/or additional accessories. Visit your authorized BMW Center for important details. Â©2018 BMW of North America, LLC.

The json format should be:
{
    "url":
        "https://www.bmwusa.com/special-offers/lease.2018-320i-Sedan.bmw.html?modal=special-offers-legal", -- url that matches a pattern understood by a handler
    "added": "2018-06-11", -- whenever this config was added
    "active": false, -- will only be processed if true, else skipped
    "handler": "bmw-usa-330i", -- corresponds to a handerl function that knows how to process the html
    "car_check": "2018 BMW 330i" -- processes for a particular model
}
